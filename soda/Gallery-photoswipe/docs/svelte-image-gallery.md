Here's a basic example on how to create a simple image gallery with Svelte. ([edit Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-3ib82v?file=src/lib/SimpleGallery.svelte)).

If you want to provide images data directly to PhotoSwipe, refer to [Data sources page](/data-sources).

There is also an unofficial [Svelte gallery component by @mvolfik](https://github.com/mvolfik/svelte-photoswipe) that could be very useful.
